# Decision Log: Building AI Products Without Illusion

## Context

In Q4 2024, the team faced a critical decision: should we add "AI-powered" features to stay competitive, or should we focus on solving real problems first?

## The Dilemma

**Option A: AI-First Approach**
- Add ChatGPT integration to every feature
- Market as "AI-powered platform"
- Risk: Building solutions looking for problems

**Option B: Problem-First Approach**
- Identify real user pain points
- Use AI only where it demonstrably helps
- Risk: Appearing "behind" competitors

## What We Decided

We chose **Option B** with a twist: validate AI use cases through small experiments first.

### Key Principles

1. **No AI for AI's sake** - Every AI feature must solve a measurable problem
2. **Start small** - Prototype with 10 users before scaling
3. **Measure ruthlessly** - Track actual usage, not vanity metrics

## The Results (3 months later)

**What worked:**
- AI-assisted code review: 40% faster PR reviews
- Automated test generation: 60% test coverage increase
- Natural language search: 3x more feature discovery

**What didn't work:**
- AI chatbot for support: Users preferred direct docs
- Auto-generated release notes: Too generic, no one read them
- Smart notifications: Created more noise than value

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Users don't care about "AI"

They care about getting their job done faster. Don't lead with the technology.

### 2. The boring problems are the best ones

AI works best on tedious, repetitive tasks. Not on creative or strategic decisions.

### 3. Human-in-the-loop always wins

Pure automation fails. AI as a copilot succeeds.

## Framework for Future Decisions

Before adding any AI feature, ask:

1. **What specific task becomes 2x easier?** (not "more intelligent")
2. **Can we measure success in user behavior?** (not just feedback)
3. **What happens when the AI is wrong?** (failure modes matter)

## Retrospective Thoughts

If I could redo this decision:

- **I'd start even smaller** - 5 users, not 10
- **I'd time-box experiments** - 2 weeks max, then kill or scale
- **I'd document failures publicly** - We learned more from what didn't work
